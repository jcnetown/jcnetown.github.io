## South American Wolf 

The South American wolf went extinct between 1454 and 1626. The South American wolf's diet was preying on small mammals and eating large carcasses, meaning it was both a carnivore and a scavenger. There is evidence of some people keeping these as pets, like at some dug up graves they find the bones of this wolf.
