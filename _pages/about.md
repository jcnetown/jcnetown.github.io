# Extinct Animals
<br>
<br>
More than 99.9% of all species to ever live have went extinct, so I can't list them all. But I have compiled 5 from each century ranging from the 15th to the 21st.

How to Use
======
To start, go to the top bar and click on "Extinct in the 21st Century" and when you're done with that, click on the next one. You may notice that it only has the 21st-19th, to access the 18th-15th click on the 3 lines on the side to open a drop down menu.

Other
======
